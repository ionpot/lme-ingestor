# Updating src/trust.pem

metalsmarket doesn't serve the entire certificate chain
- intermediate certificates missing
- Node.js error: UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE
- TLS error: unable to verify the first certificate

manually fetch the missing certs
- fetch-certificate.sh
	- downloads the metalsmarket certificate -> server.cert
	- decodes and prints the issuer URL
	- URL should point to a .crt file
- fetch-issuer-pem.sh <url>
	- downloads the issuer's .crt file (binary)
	- converts to issuer.pem (text)
	- contains intermediate certificate(s)

if ok, move issuer.pem to src/trust.pem

tell node.js:
NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=trust.pem


# Certificate chain

Server certificate - stores a certificate signed by intermediate.
Intermediate certificate - stores a certificate signed by root.
Root certificate - stores a self-signed certificate.
Intermediate certificate should be installed on the server, along with the server certificate.
Root certificates are embedded into the software applications, browsers and operating systems.

The application serving the certificate has to send the complete chain, this
means the server certificate itself and all the intermediates. The root certificate
is supposed to be known by the client.


# Scraping

http://www.metalsmarket.net/get_data.php?ms=0&sid=<sid>&rand=<new Date().getTime()>

sid = session id, obtained from login as cookie header
Set-Cookie: datamet_sid=<sid>

res.headers["set-cookie"] = [
  'datamet_sid=5E69D94803D2295D655C33A075B8B920',
  'datamet_data=deleted; expires=Thu, 01-Jan-1970 00:00:01 GMT'
]

login.php responds with 302 if login succeeds
- sends the above Set-Cookie header with the new sid

if not:
- it responds with 200 with the entire homepage
- in it with an error message

get_data.php returns 200
- if sid is invalid, response body is `invalidSession();`

in function pageLoad(page)
- comment out $(obj).hide()
- to keep cells visible as they get filled

function dataProcess3(val)
- fills cells one by one
- add breakpoint in loop
